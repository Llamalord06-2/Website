        <h2>Introduction/Origin</h2>
        <p>The predators species is called The Yaujta. they are from the planet Yaujta Prime (how creative). They are a sub species, coming from a species called The Hish, who were pretty much the same thing, but less tech based. At some point in their history, they were enslaved by a species known as The Amengi who are the source of the prototypes predator weapons, like the plasma blaster.</p>
    <h2>What Makes them so dangerous</h2>
        <p>What makes the Yaujta so dangerous is their access to technology, their hunting abilities and their skills with any weapons they come across</p>
    <p>Another factor that makes them dangerous is the fact that their weapons are nearly limitless. such as</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Plasma Canon</li>
        <li>Eagle Drones</li>
        <li>Spear</li>
        <li>Cloaking Tech</li>
        <li>Nanotech Armour</li>
        <li>Thermal Vision</li>
        <li>Ships</li>
