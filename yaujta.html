            <h2>Introduction/Origin</h2>
            <p>
                The predators species is called The Yaujta. they are from the planet Yaujta Prime (how creative). They
                are a sub species, coming from a species called The Hish, who were pretty much the same thing, but less
                tech based. At some point in their history, they were enslaved by a species known as The Amengi who are
                the source of the prototypes predator weapons, like the plasma blaster.
            </p>
            <h2>What Makes them so dangerous</h2>
            <p>
                What makes the Yaujta so dangerous is their access to technology, their hunting abilities and their
                skills with any weapons they come across
            </p>
            <p>Another factor that makes them dangerous is the fact that their weapons are nearly limitless. such as</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Eagle Drones</li>
