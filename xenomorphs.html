            <h1>The Xenomorphs</h1>
            <img src="Xeno.png" width="200" />

            <h2>Introduction/Origin</h2>
            <p>
                The Xenomorphs are rumoured to be synthetic/genetically modified bio weapons, created by the engineers,
                or some other faction. They were supposed to be a bio weapon used to kill and infect othere species, but
                evolved further and became their own creatures
            </p>

            <h2>What Makes them so dangerous</h2>
            <p>
                What makes the xenomorphs so dangerous is their adaptability. they have the ability to take traits from
                previous hosts, this could be memories, routines, or even recognising their host's siblings or
                relatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another factor that makes them dangerous is the fact that there are a lot of variations of the species,
                such as
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Predalien:<br />
                    A cross between a Yaujta and a Xenomorph. it has the positives of both species, good hunting skills,
                    Technology, Acid blood and Adaptability. There has been many Predaliens over the franchise. They are
                    seen as a dishonor to both their species and always hunted by both them.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Mr Sinister Xenomorph:<br />During a crossover with Marvel, there was an issue, where the Mutant, Mr
                    Sinister, is taken over by a xenomorph, which gained powers. These powers include, Teleportation
                    from Nightcrawler, Enhanced Durability from Colosus and supposedly telepathy. making it overall
                    dangerous
                </li>
                <li><img src="Images/red%20xeno.jpg" width="150" height="90" /></li>
                <li>
                    TMNT Xenomorph(Fan Made):<br />There are various fan made versions of the xenomorph, one of these is
                    the Turtle-Morph, a fusion of a Ninja turtle and a Xeno. This makes for a scary alien, because it
                    retained its martial arts skills and weapon ability. making the xenomorph even more stealthy and
                    deadly.
                </li>
                <li><img src="Images/turtlemorph.jpg" width="150" height="90"/></li>
                
                <li>
                    Ultramorph:<br />The ultramorph is one of the most deadly xenos in the franchise, due to it being
                    over 16+ ft tall. fast, and the most intelligent of the species. Due to the fact that he was spawned
                    from an engineer, the smartest species in the universe, this enhances its deadliness because it can
                    outthink
                </li>
                <li><img src="Images/ultramorph.jpg" width="150" height="90"/></li>
            </ol>
