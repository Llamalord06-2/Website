    <h2>What Makes them so dangerous</h2>
        <p>What makes the xenomorphs so dangerous is their adaptability. they have the ability to take traits from previous hosts, this could be memories, routines, or even recognising their host's siblings or relatives. </p>
    <p>Another factor that makes them dangerous is the fact that there are a lot of variations of the species, such as</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Xenomorph Queen</li>
        <li>Drone</li>
        <li>Warrior</li>
        <li>Runner</li>
        <li>Chest Burster</li>
        <li>Face Hugger</li>
        <li>Egg</li>

        <li>Predalien:<br> A cross between a Yaujta and a Xenomorph. it has the positives of both species, good hunting skills, Technology, Acid blood and Adaptability. There has been many Predaliens over the franchise. They are seen as a dishonor to both their species and always hunted by both them.</li>

        <li>Mr Sinister Xenomorph:<br>During a crossover with Marvel, there was an issue, where the Mutant, Mr Sinister, is taken over by a xenomorph, which gained powers. These powers include, Teleportation from Nightcrawler, Enhanced Durability from Colosus and supposedly telepathy. making it overall dangerous</li>
