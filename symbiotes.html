            </div>

            <h2>Introduction/Origin</h2>
            <p>
                The Symbiotes were created by Knull, refered to as god of the symbiotes. They are from the planet
                Klyntar, a cosmic prison holding Knull and the Necrosword. The symbiote was first introduced in Secret
                Wars, as an alien suit, worn by Spiderman, and he then kept it for a few issues. He then found out it
                was enhancing his anger and making him more violent. When eventually separated, the symbiote bonded to
                Eddie Brock. Eddie then realises that Peter Parker is spiderman, due to the symbiote hive mind informing
                him. This leads into Eddie and the symbiote becoming the Vilain/Anti Hero Venom. The most famous
                symbiote.
            </p>
            <h2>What Makes them so dangerous</h2>
            <p>
                What makes the symbiotes so dangerous is their adaptability. they have the ability to take overtake
                hosts, this allows them to survive. only if the host is compatable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another factor that makes them dangerous is the fact that thye are able to take powers from previous
                hosts, for example:

                    Venom, God of Light:<br />Venom became the God of Light after a drawn out fight with Knull. he was
                    able to take the power from Knull, and became the King In Black, basically becoming the new king of
                    all symbiotes. now he is the protector of the light as the keeper of the dark. Eddie Brock, bonded

                    was awakened when the Celestials invaded. Knull was chosen by the Celestials to serve as the King in
                    Black but he rejected the responsibility. With the first symbiote in the form of a sword, he
                    decapitated one of them and used its severed head's power to refine the blade, linking both him and
                    the Necrosword to the fallen god

                    earth, where he was dormant until Knull invaded. Grendal had a canibalistic cult form around him in
                    Denmark. they had set up behind a waterfall. some point after this, the dragons attacked Asgard, but
                    were fended off

                    name, Carnage. Carnage was already a serial killer before the symbiote, but after reciving he went
                    on a murder spree, eventually ending up dying, then resurected. Upon resurection he formed a cult
                    and began the steps of becoming Absolute Carnage, and freeing Knull
