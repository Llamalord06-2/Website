            <h1>The Kraang</h1>
            <img src="Images/Krang.jpg" width="200" />
            <h2>Introduction/Origin</h2>
            <p>
                The Kraang, in most depictions, are invaders from another dimension (Dimension X) who tried to inhabit
                earth millions of years ago, but found it, and it's environment toxic, or depending on the series, were
                locked away, or simply just left back to Dimension X. In many variations, The Kraang were the reason for
                human evolution. It is unknown where their technology came from, in some versions they stole it, in
                others they made their own. every Kraang across all dimensions (every TMNT universe is connected) are
                linked through their dimensional portal, and can travel between them, as shown in the 2012 show, where
                Kraang (1987) appeared
            </p>
            <h2>What Makes them so dangerous</h2>
            <p>
                One factor that makes this species dangerous is their technology and near endless number of soldiers.
                The Kraang are dangerous due to their supply of mutagen, which causes mutations in anything it touches
                which us used to create monsters and weapons.
            </p>
            <p>The main fear factor is their technology and weaponry which includes things such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Stealth Ships</li>
                <li>Laser Guns</li>
                <li>Drones</li>
                <li>Footbots</li>
                <li>Biotroids</li>
                <li>FootBots</li>
                <li>Technodrome</li>
                <li>Mutagen</li>
            </ul>

                    Kraang Prime:<br />
                    By far the most powerful form of The Kraang. Kraang Prime is over 10x the size of every other
                    Kraang. This is due to experemintations on himself. Kraang Prime has access to things like
                    dimensional travel, unstable mutagen, endless soldiers and the technodrome
                </li>

                <li>
                    Kraang Sub-Prime<br />Just below the top spot. Kraang Sub-Prime is second in command for this
                    specific universes Kraang, he has access to technological enhancements, cyborg suits, rockets, and
                    his own personal mech suit equipped with hundreds of weapons and is also capable of opening

                <li>
                    Kraang One/Two/Three<br />These Kraang are dangerous due to them having similar intelligence and the
                    ability to work as a team with one another. They have been shown to have access to inter dimensional
                    travel, their own technodrome and the ability to create "Kraang Zombies" that they can control

                    universes Shredder, and even getting the drop on him. He is shown to have his own technodrome, the
                    downside being it needs to gather its own organic material to form, he is shown to have his
                    "Mandroid" mech suit.

            <h2>Fun Trivia</h2>
            <p>The versions of Kraang, known as Kraang Sub-Prime and Kraang (1987) are recognised as cousins.</p>
            <p>Kraang isn't the name of the species. The species is known as "The Utrom" and they are not all bad.</p>
            <p>
                Many Kraang have access to the multiverse, and have been seen in several other universes, Like DC or
                power rangers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name of the antagonist in the most recent movie, is "Cynthia Utrom" possibly hinting at her being a
                Kraang Droid
